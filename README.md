# PUMA Lab Website (GitHub Pages)

This repository contains the source code for the lab website, hosted via GitHub Pages and built using Jekyll. 

The site is data-driven where possible (people, carousel, research blogs) and uses BibTeX for publications, so most updates do not require editing HTML.

The website can currently be accessed at:
```
https://madison-nlp.github.io/puma-lab/
```

## Deployment (One-Time)

The site is deployed via GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.
- Repository: `puma-lab`
- Deployment: `Settings` -> `Pages` -> `Build and deployment` -> Source: `GitHub Actions`
- Live URL: `https://madison-nlp.github.io/puma-lab/`
  - Or custom domain if configured

**Important:** This site depends on Jekyll. Do not add a `.nojekyll` file.

The publications page uses Jekyll plugins from `Gemfile` (`jekyll-scholar` and `al_folio_core`). Build/deploy with Bundler so those plugins are available.
